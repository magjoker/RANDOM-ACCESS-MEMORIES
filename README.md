## Description
If there's anyone on Earth who knows about procrastination, its me. That's why I built this app! To help those who use it to organize their day. That will hopefully result in more productivity. Just type what it is you want to get done in the box next to the time you'd like to do it. If you press the blue save button after you type, it will save whatever you wrote until you change it. The time blocks are also color coded. Grey is the Past, red is the Present, and green is the Future. Check it out at https://magjoker.github.io/RANDOM-ACCESS-MEMORIES/
